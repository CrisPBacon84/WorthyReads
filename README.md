# Worthy Reads

This app is part of appeofiesta hackathon organized by GDSC at MMDU, Mullana.
Worthy Reads reccomends good books and helps you keep track of books you are reading/planning to read.

This app uses firebase_auth and google_sign_in for user authentication and http for getting data from the api that we have created.
